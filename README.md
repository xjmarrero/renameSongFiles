removes brand name i-funbox from the end of song file names



This program iterates through a folder and removes a specific word from the file name.

This is was created due to a music management software called i-funbox, similar to iTunes, added its brandname to the end of
each song title name. This messed up the iPhone music app sorting feature. This python program fixes this by removing
the brandname from the song file name.
